## **TidyTaps**

Had to prep for my <ins>3 concerts</ins>  next week and realized I had <ins>no storage</ins>  left on my phone for videos.
Made this because I got tired of scrolling through my 16,000 photos in the Photos app.
Thatâ€™s it ;p

What it does:

- Quick Keep / Delete/ Undo flow for photos

- Delete Queue so nothing disappears too fast

- Safe final delete (goes to iOS Photos App 'Recently Deleted')

- All local, all private
-
